## Nestjs Microservices

In this project, I created a Nest.js project with Microservices along with an API Gateway using this helpful tutorial [Nest.js Microservices Tutorial in 20 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C250DCwS81Q) by Michael Guay

To run this project, you should clone this project on your local and start seperately using this command;

- npm run start:dev

and check whether it works properly using Postman
